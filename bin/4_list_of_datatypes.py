    After creating with some values then throught the program we CAN'T change
    the values
- Numbers: 
    -- We have option to store numbers like int, float etc

    -- We have option to store text-data/collection of characters like name, email-id etc
    -- Automatically index number will be assigned to each character
- Tuple:
    -- We have option to store multiple values like list of names, list of ids etc
    -- Here we can keep DUPLICATE values
    -- Automatically index number will be assigned to each value
- Frozenset:
    -- We have option to store multiple values like list of names, list of ids etc
    -- Here we can keep UNIQUE values
    -- No index number to each value

- Dictionary:
    -- We have option to store multiple values like list of names, list of ids etc
    -- Here we can keep DUPLICATE values
    -- Here, MANUALLY we can/need to provide index to each value called KEY/VALUE pair
---- All are heterogeneous and we can store different data types in tuple, list etc
